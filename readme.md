This is my first project learning rust.
So far this is only a command line app testing how to show messages.  

To run: 
1. Run `cargo build` from the project root directory
2. Then run `cargo run` to view the project. 

This app will ask the user for an input string. Ferris will then answer whether he can answer if RUST
can be built from the characters entered or not.
